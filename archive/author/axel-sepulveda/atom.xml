&lt;p&gt;2020 was a rough year for everyone,
including our team.
We managed to make it through,
and continue to have 5 folks working full-time to make Read the Docs better for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going into 2021 with a &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../czi-grant-announcement.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;new grant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which will require us to do some &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../jobs.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;hiring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
We also launched our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ethicalads.io/&quot;&gt;EthicalAds network&lt;/a&gt;,
which is bringing our approach to sustainability to the tech community as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have for the past 7 years,
we are proud to share our 2020 stats post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first admonition-title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our stats for the last &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.seethestats.com/site/readthedocs.org&quot;&gt;30 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last&quot;&gt;Our posts from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2013-stats/&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2014-stats/&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2015-stats/&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2016-stats/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2017-stats/&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2018-stats/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2019-stats/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;page-views&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Page Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;580 Million Page Views (from 465 million)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;156 Million Unique Visitors (from 120 million)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers are not completely accurate, since we &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../do-not-track.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;implemented Do Not Track support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; our analytics pageview figures understate our actual traffic.
We estimate that around 6% of users are not counted here.
We also don’t count all the users who block Google Analytics with a browser extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;site-stats&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats, in total numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;240,000 projects (from 200,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;430,000 users (from 400,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2,480,063 builds (from 10 million total last year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been battling spam quite heavily again this year,
so these numbers are a bit skewed.
We do notice a uptick in usage across the site,
both in terms of support and traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/graphs/contributors?from=2020-01-01&amp;amp;to=2020-12-31&amp;amp;type=c&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who committed code to the main repository (from 21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3636 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/commits/master&quot;&gt;commits&lt;/a&gt; (from 4793)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;532 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2020-01-01..2020-12-31+&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; - 104 open, 428 closed (from 609)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working to move user support issues to email from GitHub,
which likely addresses the reduction in ticket numbers.
We are also working to expand our ecosystem of projects,
so the commits to the main repository are down.
We expect across our theme, extensions, and other projects commits are up this year,
and we’re appreciative of all the work people contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$234,000 advertising (from $249,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$30,000 Gold users and donations (from $26,600)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 paid staff (same as last year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have additional revenue from our commercial offering at readthedocs.com, but aren’t including that in our community funding overview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ethicalads.io/&quot;&gt;EthicalAds&lt;/a&gt;, we are excited to continue to grow our advertising business,
and expand it to the larger community.
We are also seeing continued growth of our paid product at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.com&quot;&gt;https://readthedocs.com&lt;/a&gt;,
which is allowing us to fund further growth of the Read the Docs codebase for all our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to work to improve Read the Docs for our users.
We’re excited for the growth we expect in 2021,
and hope that you’ll join us for the next chapter of our story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 was another good year for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/&quot;&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;.
We continue to have a team of 5 folks working on the project,
and we’ve rolled out a number of new features for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our stats for the past year,
which we’ve published since 2013.
This is part of our effort to be transparent in our organization,
as well as our source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition note&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;page-views&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Page Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;465 Million Page Views (from 400M)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120 Million Unique Visitors (from 77M)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers are not completely accurate, since we &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../do-not-track.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;implemented Do Not Track support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year, our analytics pageview figures understate our actual traffic.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;site-stats&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats, in total numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200,000 projects (from 100k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;400,000 users (from 150k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10,188,182 builds (new this year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been battling spam quite heavily again this year,
so these numbers are a bit skewed.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/graphs/contributors?from=2019-01-01&amp;amp;to=2019-12-31&amp;amp;type=c&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who committed code to the main repository (from 28)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4793 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/commits/master&quot;&gt;commits&lt;/a&gt; (from 3774)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;609 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2019-01-01..2019-12-31+&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; - 80 open, 529 closed (from 797)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have continued to have a similar team working on the project this year,
but have actually made more commits.
We moved our support queue from issues to email,
which likely accounts for the lower issue count.
We’re quite happy with our closed issue stats this year,
which are much better than previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$275,000 in revenue from readthedocs.org (from 294,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$249,000 from advertising (from $278,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$26,600 from Gold users (from $16,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have additional revenue from our commercial offering at readthedocs.com, but aren’t including that in our community funding overview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our advertising has been pretty steady for 2019.
The small drop in the year-over-year comparison we account to the fact that ad blockers happened halfway through 2018,
meaning that the comparison is 15% lower in terms of our total traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to be hosted by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;,
and we’re using a lot of their nicer feature to keep our costs down.
You can find some posts on our blog about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to keep working to improve the documentation ecosystem in the software industry.
We’re excited about a number of new features that we’re working on this year,
and expect to continue to be a resource you can depend on for a long time to come :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 was another good year for &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/&quot;&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;.
We’ve settled into a sustainability model that is working for us,
and have a team of 5 folks working full-time on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our stats for the past year,
which we’ve published for the past 6 years.
This is part of our effort to be transparent in our organization,
as well as our source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first admonition-title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our stats for the last &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.seethestats.com/site/readthedocs.org&quot;&gt;30 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last&quot;&gt;Our posts from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2013-stats/&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2014-stats/&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2015-stats/&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2016-stats/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2017-stats/&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;page-views&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Page Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;400 Million Page Views (up from 338M, 18%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;77 Million Unique Visitors (up from 75M, 3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers are not completely accurate, since we &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../do-not-track.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;implemented Do Not Track support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May, our analytics pageview figures understate our actual traffic.
We estimate that around 6% of users are not counted here.
We also don’t count all the users who block Google Analytics with a browser extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;site-stats&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats, in total numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100,000 projects (up from 77k, 30%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;155,000 users (up from 103k, 50%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been battling spam quite heavily again this year,
so these numbers are a bit skewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/graphs/contributors?from=2018-01-01&amp;amp;to=2018-12-31&amp;amp;type=c&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who committed code to the main repository (up from 23, 22%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3774 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/commits/master&quot;&gt;commits&lt;/a&gt; (up from 1058, 257%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;797 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue++created%3A2018-01-01..2019-01-01+&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; - 189 open, 608 closed (up from 513, 55%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the number of commits and issues has gone up quite a bit.
This is largely because of the additional staffing we have had on the project,
allowing us to be more active to both our users and to release more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$294,000 in revenue from readthedocs.org (up from $218,000, 35%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$278,000 from advertising (up 59%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$16,000 from Gold users (up 16%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have additional revenue from our commercial offering at readthedocs.com, but aren’t including that in our community funding overview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest impact to our revenue this year was &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../ads-and-adblocking.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;our ads being blocked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This happened in May,
and caused an initial 32% reduction in our ad revenue.
We were &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../ad-blocker-update.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;added to the Acceptable Ads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; list later in the month,
which regained around half of our revenue.
So for the second half of the year,
our ad revenue was down about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also exploring sharing revenue with our documentation authors.
There are currently 3 projects enrolled in a revenue share,
and we’re hoping to expand that in 2019 to better support open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is now on firm financial footing.
We have a cash reserve that will allow us to pay all of our staff for more than 3 months in the event of a loss of revenue,
which allows us to be more flexible with our revenue going forward.
This funding allowed us to expand from 4 to 5 full-time folks working on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also moved hosting to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; this year in August from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://rackspace.com/&quot;&gt;Rackspace&lt;/a&gt;,
who both have sponsored our hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we’ve continued to invest in our ethical advertising approach,
growing our team by one member and building lots of new features.
It feels like the project is progressing quite well,
and we’re committing way more code and dealing with a much larger number of user issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like success to be able to properly support our community by improving the product,
while creating a business model that we can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ethical-advertising-works&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been two years since we first launched &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../ads-on-read-the-docs.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;ads on Read the Docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
We figured it was time to report on the results that we’ve seen,
and say thanks to those who have helped us along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Advertising works&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q1 2018,
our estimated revenue from advertising is $75,000.
This is enough to fund our small team of 4 people to work on Read the Docs full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started building our ethical advertising model,
we didn’t know how it would work out.
We didn’t know much about the ad industry,
and we were doing things different than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to report that you can build advertising that is a win/win/win for all parties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs wins because we generate revenue, allowing us to sustain our operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertisers win because they are able to reach our audience of developers, helping to grow their business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users win because their privacy is maintained, and they continue to have access to our service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical advertising on Read the Docs has not been without its challenges,
which we will cover in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;tracking-users-isn-t-required&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tracking users isn’t required&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we’ve been trying to prove a simple thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have successful advertising without tracking our users.
So much of the trouble facing the ad industry these days is because of this massive databases of user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been able to show that we can show ads without knowing exactly who our users are.
The content they are reading is enough to show them targeted ads,
without knowing anything about them.
Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not let advertisers run 3rd party code on Read the Docs. Ad images and javascript is all hosted by us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not provide advertisers with data dumps, except aggregated reports on the clicks and views their ads got.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We target our ads based only on geography and the details of the page being visited, not on a profile of the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re now taking a look at what we’ve learned,
and how we might help more infrastructure projects reach sustainability with an ethical advertising approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;towards-an-ethical-ad-network&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Towards an Ethical Ad Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have shown that an advertising business model that respects users can also sustain critical open source infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt;
We hope that we can act as an example for other projects that depend on ads.
You can make money without giving away your users data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers have the power to shift the ad industry to respect user privacy.
We must start with our own projects,
leading by example.
We need to have all the ads in the open source ecosystem respect user privacy,
and then we can start to apply pressure to other parts of the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We realize that not every open source project can do all the work that we’ve done.
We want to explore how we can build an &lt;strong&gt;Ethical Ad Network&lt;/strong&gt;,
where user data isn’t sent to us,
but each project doesn’t need to do ad sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical ad network is still in the planning phases,
but if you know a project that might be interested in being a beta tester,
please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ads&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank all of companies who have believed in our ethical ads initiative.
You can only sell something if people buy it,
and I’d like to give credit to the folks who have believed in our concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twilio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rollbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mongo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted Graphite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Impact Alliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exoscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircleCI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry Servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniregistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSCON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;read-the-docs-2017-stats&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 was a good year for Read the Docs.
We’ve settled into a sustainability model that is working for us,
and have started to grow our team to be able to better support the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our stats for the past year,
which we’ve published for the past 5 years.
This is part of our effort to be transparent in our organization,
as well as our source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first admonition-title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our stats for the last &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.seethestats.com/site/readthedocs.org&quot;&gt;30 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last&quot;&gt;Our posts from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2013-stats/&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2014-stats/&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2015-stats/&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2016-stats/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;page-views&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Page Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;338 Million Page Views (up from 252M in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75 Million Unique Visitors (up from 56M in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remain one of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/readthedocs.io&quot;&gt;largest sites&lt;/a&gt; on the internet.
Turns out &lt;em&gt;a lot of people&lt;/em&gt; read documentation each day for open source projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;site-stats&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats, in total numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;77,000 projects (up from 53k in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;103,000 users (up from 65k in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been battling spam quite heavily this year,
so these numbers might be a bit skewed.
I believe they should be pretty accurate in terms of percentage growth though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/graphs/contributors?from=2017-01-01&amp;amp;to=2017-12-31&amp;amp;type=c&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who committed code to the main repository (up from 18 in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1058 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/commits/master&quot;&gt;commits&lt;/a&gt; (similar to 1032 in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;513 &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A%3E%3D2017-01-01&amp;amp;type=Issues&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; - 194 open, 319 closed (up from 461 in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$250,000 in revenue (up from $75,000 in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have four full-time people working on the project.
This has made it feel like we’re able to move forward,
instead of simply fighting to stay in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our largest initiative this year has been our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html&quot;&gt;Ethical Advertising&lt;/a&gt; initiative.
It has been going quite well,
and is the primary driver of our ability to hire a team to work on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our other two funding sources are readthedocs.com &amp;amp; donations.
Both are bringing in appreciable amounts of money,
but the advertising is at around 5x the combined value of our other revenue sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hosting costs continue to be sponsored by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://rackspace.com/&quot;&gt;Rackspace&lt;/a&gt;,
which is fantastically generous of them.
We’re looking at moving hosting providers in 2018,
because Rackspace is winding down their support for OSS hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have decided to invest in building a sustainable business instead of trying to work only on volunteer effort.
This has allowed us to focus on things we can control,
build a small team,
and help improve the product for all of our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to continuing to grow into 2018!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;moss-final-report&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year,
we were given a &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../rtd-awarded-mozilla-open-source-support-grant.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;MOSS Award&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to work on improving the Python documentation ecosystem.
We &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../announcing-pydoc-io.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the initial deployment last November,
and this is the retrospective post about how the project as a whole went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is live at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pydoc.io/&quot;&gt;http://www.pydoc.io/&lt;/a&gt; and on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/pydoc.io&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rtfd/pydoc.io&lt;/a&gt; - the source code for the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi&lt;/a&gt; - the source code for parse-only API generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/apitheme&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rtfd/apitheme&lt;/a&gt; - A Sphinx theme for API docs (incomplete)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pydoc.io was created to generate API documentation for all Python packages.
We have now generated over 17,000 sets of API documentation for packages uploaded to PyPI,
without executing a single line of Python code from those projects.
This is the primary goal of the project,
and it has been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original grant covered the following items,
which I’ll talk about in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add to Read the Docs the ability to build documentation from a release tarball of code in addition to the existing ability to build it from a version control system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add to Read the Docs the ability to generate API documentation by parsing the Python code rather than by importing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add automatic documentation generation to the next version of the Python Package Index, Warehouse (&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://warehouse.python.org/&quot;&gt;https://warehouse.python.org/&lt;/a&gt;) - both API documentation and Sphinx documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build out a custom hosting infrastructure for a new domain (&amp;lt;package&amp;gt;.pythondocs.com) or (&amp;lt;package&amp;gt;.python.readthedocs.org).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appropriate testing of the new code, and supporting the Python community in using the new facility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking through each point,
I’ll cover a few higher level thoughts on the topic of grant funding open source services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;add-ability-to-build-docs-from-a-tarball&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add ability to build docs from a tarball&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was focused on adding the ability to work with tarballs (zip files) instead of Version Control systems to Read the Docs.
As we got further into the development,
we &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1957&quot;&gt;realized&lt;/a&gt; it would be simpler to just create a new code project,
instead of trying to adapt Read the Docs for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up creating the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/pydoc.io&quot;&gt;pydoc.io&lt;/a&gt; project as a new Django application.
It explicitly works with PyPI to download packages,
and doesn’t know anything about Version Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did this for a number of reasons,
but the primary one was to enable contributions.
The Read the Docs codebase had &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of complexity around VCS,
and that complexity makes it hard to work on.
We are hoping that development on Pydoc will be adopted by the community,
in a manner that Read the Docs hasn’t been.
Keeping the project simple and easy to contribute to was a large goal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating an entirely new code base also required us to spend time starting from scratch.
Instead of leveraging our own modeling,
hosting,
and other infrastructure,
we have to create it all again from scratch.
This ate up a decent amount of time that could have otherwise been spent on development,
but I think it still makes more sense to do it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;add-ability-to-generate-sphinx-documentation-with-parsing-instead-of-importing-python-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add ability to generate Sphinx documentation with parsing instead of importing Python code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work has been mostly successful,
and lives in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi/&quot;&gt;sphinx-autoapi&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As covered in the initial grant proposal,
having a parse-only solution for API documentation is a useful tool in the Python community.
This allows us to generate API docs for arbitrary code that is published to PyPI,
without having to execute it.
However,
given Python’s dynamic nature,
there will always be some subset of data that can only be gathered by running the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have gotten the autoapi solution to a point where we consider it about 90% done,
and it is generally useful.
You can see it in action on any project that is published to Pydoc currently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/invenio-admin-1.0.0b2/autoapi/ext/index.html&quot;&gt;https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/invenio-admin-1.0.0b2/autoapi/ext/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/actappliance-0.3.2/index.html&quot;&gt;https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/actappliance-0.3.2/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/pyote-1.4.dev0/index.html&quot;&gt;https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/pyote-1.4.dev0/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;add-automatic-documentation-generation-as-packages-are-published-to-pypi&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Add automatic documentation generation as packages are published to PyPI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the primary value of the Pydoc &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/pydoc.io&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;.
It is an implementation of a Django app that polls PyPI,
and generates API documentation for each package as it is published.
Currently we are only supporting the Wheel format,
and projects published on Python 3.
We view this as a way to get people to move their packages into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We currently have over &lt;strong&gt;10,000&lt;/strong&gt; versions published to Pydoc.
We have been live building API documentation since the release of the beta in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;testing-of-the-new-code-and-support-the-community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing of the new code, and support the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have written some good unit tests for the autoapi code,
but pydoc.io itself is not as well tested as it could be.
In terms of supporting the community,
that hasn’t been happening since we haven’t gotten much uptake in usage.
I’ll cover this a bit more in the take aways below,
but there is a large amount of marketing that would need to happen in order for us to fulfill the full value of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;high-level-take-aways&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Level Take Aways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we applied for the grant,
the idea was to extend the ability of Read the Docs and Sphinx.
In extending Read the Docs,
we have mostly failed.
We broke Pydoc out into its own project,
in order to make it much easier to contribute to.
&lt;strong&gt;This means that little of the work has been contributed back to Read the Docs code itself.&lt;/strong&gt;
However,
we have done a lot of work around building extensions to Sphinx.
This is work that is more widely applicable to any Sphinx user,
which is more useful in general for the Python and programming community as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating open source software and not telling people about it is not inherently valuable.&lt;/strong&gt;
We did work on the major aspects of the grant,
but we didn’t have the energy or focus to actually spend time marketing the new tools we have created.
Originally when we took the grant,
we thought it would be part of Read the Docs,
and so would naturally get exposure that way.
Once the site was split out as a separate instance,
it become necessary to market that,
along with all the other work we were already doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that we’ve struggled with in funding and sustainability is the fact that we are a service.
&lt;strong&gt;We felt that we needed to ask MOSS for money to complete specific,
actionable features.&lt;/strong&gt;
What we really need is funding for operating the service (wearing a pager),
supporting our users (responding to issues on GitHub),
helping mentor new contributors (reviewing Pull Requests),
and other activities that don’t have a flashy outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that one thing that would help here is an explicit MOSS track that covers services or sustaining maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt;
A lot of funding is geared towards new development and R&amp;amp;D,
and there needs to be more money out there for simply keeping things going.
That would have been the most valuable money that we could have taken,
and in the end,
building out new capacity ended up effectively being more of a distraction from our core project goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also spent a good deal of time creating our own API theme: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/apitheme&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rtfd/apitheme&lt;/a&gt;.
We realized part of the way through development that we should focus on getting the basic project done,
and we could focus on nicer theming later.
This ate up a chunk of time that wasn’t necessary,
but I think the vision for a dedicated Sphinx API doc theme is a good one.
This is another place where we could bring in the community to hopefully work towards a better outcome,
but needed to dedicate time for that activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end,
we’re glad we got the experience doing this MOSS grant,
and know a lot more about doing something similar in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ads-on-the-alabaster-theme-on-read-the-docs-community-sites&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been running our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advertising/ethical-advertising.html&quot; title=&quot;(in Read the Docs user documentation v6.3.2)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xref std std-doc&quot;&gt;ethical advertising&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; campaign for over a year now,
and it is starting to show success on making Read the Docs more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over this time,
we have only been running ads on Read the Docs themed projects.
The primary reason for this is making sure that our display of ads is consistent and doesn’t negatively impact the user experience.
We’re trying hard to build a sustainability model that respects our users,
and making sure things are well designed and unobtrusive is an important part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve planned on expanding to other themes,
but we haven’t simply because it didn’t give us any value.
We serve about 60% of our traffic on the Read the Docs theme,
so until we have 100% of those views sold,
we haven’t expanded the themes.
We’ve now hit that limit,
so we’re planning to expand to our second most popular theme:
&lt;strong&gt;Alabaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We view our ad program as a way to raise revenue,
and use that to better support the community.
There are other ways that we can support the community as well,
so today we’re also launching a &lt;strong&gt;Community Ads&lt;/strong&gt; initiative.
This will highlight projects in the community that we believe in and care about,
and use around 10% of our traffic for those ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explicitly repeat:
&lt;strong&gt;we will start showing ads on Alabaster themes on Read the Docs&lt;/strong&gt; starting in the beginning of July.
We plan to roll this out in stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll email the project owners of all projects using the Alabaster theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll start with an initial ad that points to this blog post for a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then showing our Community Ad on Alabaster projects for a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we’ll expand to our full paid ad rotation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read below to learn more about these specific projects,
and what we’re doing with the money it brings in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contents local topic&quot; id=&quot;contents&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;#changes-to-our-advertising-program&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;Changes to our advertising program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;changes-to-our-advertising-program&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;#id1&quot;&gt;Changes to our advertising program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with this expansion of where we show the theme,
we’re also updating our ad program in a few ways.
In particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will start showing Community Ads on around 10% of our traffic, for free. This will promote other open source projects, and other products/projects that we think are important, but don’t have money for ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects that opt out of normal advertising, as previously supported, will now be shown &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; ads from our Community Ads partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be able to opt out of all paid ads with a profile setting, but will still see Community Ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advertising/ethical-advertising.html#opting-out&quot; title=&quot;(in Read the Docs user documentation v6.3.2)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xref std std-ref&quot;&gt;learn more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about opting out in our docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;community-ads&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;#id2&quot;&gt;Community Ads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a large number of projects that we care about in the software ecosystem. A large number of them are operate like we have for the past 6 years, with almost no income. Our new Community Ads program will highlight one of these projects each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll show 10% of our ad inventory each month to support an open source project that we care about.
We are working to set up an application process to be considered,
but we’ve already picked our first Community Ad recipients: &lt;strong&gt;Sustain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Beeware&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://pybee.org/&quot;&gt;Beeware&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of projects that can be used to help develop, debug and launch Python software. Each tool follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. The primary goal is to bring Python to the browser, mobile devices, and everywhere else that we wish Python ran natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sustainoss.org/&quot;&gt;Sustain&lt;/a&gt; is a one-day conference about open source sustainability. We ran ads for it earlier this month, and it is now sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;project-user-opt-out-changes&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;#id3&quot;&gt;Project &amp;amp; User opt out changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we’ve allowed project owners to opt out of advertising.
We’re now expanding this to allow users to opt out of advertising as well.
We are changing the meaning of opting out to mean opting out of paid ads.
Everyone who has opted out of paid advertising will be shown Community Ads instead.
We know some folks disagree with the ideas of companies paying for their attention,
but we believe that supporting the efforts of projects in the community should be important to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To repeat,
&lt;strong&gt;Users and Projects can now opt out of paid ads, but will be shown Community Ads instead&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-we-re-doing-with-the-money&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;#id4&quot;&gt;What we’re doing with the money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a couple primary things that we are spending money on,
and plan to spend money on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying part of the full-time salaries for the primary maintainers of Read the Docs (Eric Holscher &amp;amp; Anthony Johnson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying for contractors in order to support our users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to talk a bit more on each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;paying-salaries&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;#id5&quot;&gt;Paying Salaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is a massive internet service.
We serve around 30 million _pageviews_ a month (calculated by Google Analytics, this is over 200 million _requests_ a month.)
We are currently running the entire show with two full-time staff,
which is incredibly understaffed compared to most internet services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that over time we will be able to pay salaries for more people,
but it’s hard to find qualified people who will work at below market rates.
So,
we’re focusing on hiring contractors at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;paying-to-support-our-users&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;#id6&quot;&gt;Paying to support our users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the primary goal of our new income from advertising.
We brought on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/humitos&quot;&gt;Manuel Kauffman&lt;/a&gt; for his time helping support our users on our GitHub issue tracker.
We plan to expand this program with new income,
so that we are able to provide our open source users with better support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;please-give-us-feedback&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;#id7&quot;&gt;Please give us feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re making these changes to continue building a sustainable business model for open source.
We try to be transparent with our thinking,
and along those lines we’d like to know your thoughts.
If there is anything else we could be doing better,
please &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:dev&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;uniregistry-sponsors-read-the-docs-and-open-source&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://uniregistry.com/readthedocs&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;../../_images/uniregistry-top.jpg&quot; src=&quot;../../_images/uniregistry-top.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re excited to announce an important sponsorship partner in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advertising/ethical-advertising.html&quot; title=&quot;(in Read the Docs user documentation v6.3.2)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xref std std-doc&quot;&gt;Ethical Advertising&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; campaign: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://uniregistry.com/readthedocs&quot;&gt;Uniregistry&lt;/a&gt;. Our goal with our ethical advertising program is to provide important funding for open source, and show that it can be done ethically – without tracking our users and only offering ads from relevant partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain registration was identified early as a natural partner to our program, because it sits in the stack of necessary infrastructure for all of us that work on making the internet. We wanted the right partner, because historically we feel that domain registration companies have had awful UX. We’ll cover a few of the criteria we used to reach the conclusion to partner with Uniregistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve worked with Uniregistry to offer 25% off first year registrations and/or transfers for Read the Docs users&lt;/strong&gt;,
using the code &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;DOCS25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://uniregistry.com/readthedocs&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; now to get started.
Purchasing domain names with Uniregistry is easy and secure,
and you’ll find a number of features that you won’t find with other registrars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;usability&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniregistry makes every interaction simple and minimal.
This pays off with a complete experience that should delight you.
It doesn’t suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain registration starts with search.
Their clutter-free, fast-loading search gives access to hundreds of TLDs worldwide.
They make everything you might need to do possible within one or two clicks, instead of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have native apps on iOS and Android, and make it easy to grab a new domain, manage your existing names, or transfer in and out at your leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;privacy-and-security&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Privacy and Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniregistry offers free WHOIS Privacy on every domain. There’s no nickel-and-diming to protect your personal information. In recent years, those of you who have your phone numbers and emails on domain registration have come to experience being heckled by automated phone calls and spam. Uniregistry takes this off the table with no extra cost to you.  Uniregistry’s competitors charge between $3.99 and $7.99 for what should be your right, not a paid privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two step verification is built right into the product as well. They are the registrar for people who own one domain or thousands, so they had to build in security and tools to put you in complete control. Since they have handled the use case of the most demanding domain owners in the industry, you get the same benefits even if you just buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external image-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://uniregistry.com/readthedocs&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;../../_images/uniregistry-interface.jpg&quot; src=&quot;../../_images/uniregistry-interface.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;price&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most domain registrars which provide good pricing are constantly up-selling and playing renewal games that cost money.  Uniregistry offer transparent, honest pricing on your most valuable assets. They have built a business like we would, they have never charged its customers for WHOIS privacy, they believe that freedom from unwelcome solicitation or online harassment is a fundamental right, not an opportunity for an upsell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniregistry is hyper-focused on domain registration. They don’t offer hosting, so you are not being up-sold constantly. Their pricing across the board is competitive, while providing a first class experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we worked with Uniregistry to give you a discount for not only new domain purchases, but also your transfers. Use this link as our thank you for supporting open source through your domain registration. &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://uniregistry.com/readthedocs&quot;&gt;Try it&lt;/a&gt; and see if you agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;no-lock-in&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Lock-in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniregistry doesn’t hide things like domain transfer codes. Domain renewals are a major source of cheap profit for other hosts, but it’s quite simple to switch with Uniregistry. They provide the transparency required to be a long term partner to you in managing your online presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-story-behind-the-story&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Story behind the story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniregistry was founded by Frank Schilling. They are the fastest growing registrar on the planet, driven by Frank, who is the best-known individual on the planet when it comes to domain registration. Under his direction, they have grown to be the operator of 25 new gTLDs, with more than 3.5 million domains under management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this sponsorship, Frank said, “I have a deep level of respect and love for this industry. I want nothing more than to grow a sustainable and dynamic business that empowers future generations of entrepreneurs, domain name investors, online businesses, and individual users around the world. The ultimate goal of Uniregistry is to make getting online easy. I believe we’re improving that experience each day. We are helping our customers unlock the tremendous power of their domains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to partner with Uniregistry to offer you a great domain experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniregistry is offering our users 25% off first year registrations and/or transfers into Uniregistry, using the code &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;DOCS25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
We hope that you’ll enjoy getting started with the service,
and find it as useful as we do.
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://uniregistry.com/readthedocs&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; now to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some small print: &lt;em&gt;Terms: Offer valid from March 31, 2017 to May 31, 2017 at 23:59:59 UTC for first year registrations and/or transfers in to Uniregistry.com.

&lt;p&gt;Congrats,
you made it through 2016!
Read the Docs has been rolling along,
and we’ve had another interesting year as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our level of contributions and commits has gone down a good bit this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our traffic and user growth has been quite steady, which is particularly impressive at the scale we’re operating at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our efforts at funding the project have also started to bear fruit, and 2017 is looking to be the year that Read the Docs will become a sustainable project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will go into more detail below about each of these details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonition note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first admonition-title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our stats for the last &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.seethestats.com/site/readthedocs.org&quot;&gt;30 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last&quot;&gt;Our posts from &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2013-stats/&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2014-stats/&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2015-stats/&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;page-views&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Page Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;252 Million Page Views (+48%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;56 Million Unique Visitors (+47%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page view growth has been steady again this year.
This is particularly impressive given the scale that we’re operating at.
We’re quite happy to see folks using Read the Docs more and more,
as well as seeing many other projects using our theme or other concepts that we’ve pioneered in the general software ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remain one of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/readthedocs.io&quot;&gt;largest sites&lt;/a&gt; on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;site-stats&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats, in total numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;53673 projects (+91%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;64585 users (+65%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs has some high profile projects that push a lot of traffic.
There are however thousands of smaller libraries and projects that fill out that full range of documentation that we host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to host documentation for all open source projects,
and are glad the community finds the service useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/graphs/contributors?from=2016-01-01&amp;amp;to=2016-12-31&amp;amp;type=c&quot;&gt;18 people&lt;/a&gt; who committed code (-50% from last year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/commits/master&quot;&gt;1032 commits&lt;/a&gt; (-46%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=created%3A%3E%3D2016-01-01&amp;amp;type=Issues&quot;&gt;461 issues&lt;/a&gt; - 236 open, 225 closed (-42%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our community activity is much lower this year,
which is a multi-year trend that we’ve been seeing.
This is in part due to the maturity of the project and code base,
but also because we’ve struggled to attract and retain new contributors.
The code base and project are reasonably hard to set up,
and we haven’t had enough time and focus on onboarding contributors into the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as a hosted service,
the majority of issues we receive are support requests.
These issues don’t necessarily lend to user contributions,
and are generally low priority for us as we don’t have any additional time to volunteer to resolving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been our plan to address this support gap for a while.
Starting this year,
we plan to create a part-time role, dedicated to handling support.
Ideally, we would promote someone from our community for this role,
however this pool doesn’t exist at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As maintainers,
we are discouraged by the continued lack of interest in contributing to our project,
but fully realize that we also have a role in this.
We can reduce complexity and make our projects more approachable.
We can also be more vocal about where and how you can start to contribute.
In the past, we assumed users would come to us with interest in contributing,
however we’ve also received feedback that it’s not apparent we require the help.
If you’re interested in contributing,
never hesitate to ask where you can contribute.
We’re happy to have contributions of any size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We certainly aren’t the only project that has trouble attracting contributions,
there is a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure&quot;&gt;plethora of examples&lt;/a&gt; in the open source ecosystem of this problem.
It would be great if projects could rely strictly on volunteers for maintenance,
however there are economics of this problem that we can solve by ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hosting costs continue to be sponsored by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://rackspace.com/&quot;&gt;Rackspace&lt;/a&gt;,
which is fantastically generous of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our largest initiative this year has been our attempt at building &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html&quot;&gt;Ethical Advertising&lt;/a&gt; into our site.
The project has been well received,
which we have been grateful for.
Funding is a fundamental part of sustainability,
and we’re glad people are supportive of our efforts to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best outcome of our sustainability efforts is that we’re going to be able to hire someone part time to handle support for our users.
Support has always been an area that we have not done our best work,
nor have we had enough time to handle it well.
We’re excited to give support and community development more consistent attention,
and hope that it leads to a better experience for users and perhaps even more contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our other efforts at sustainability are also progressing. Our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.com/&quot;&gt;commercial hosting service&lt;/a&gt; is starting to slowly build revenue from users who want private documentation.
We hope to continue to build that into another source of revenue,
which can help support development of the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 has been another year of mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuing to see more users and folks who are reading documentation on our platform.
We think the software industry is caring more and more about documentation by the year,
and we’re helping to play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside is that as a community project,
we still continue to have trouble attracting contributions, especially repeat contributions.
We hope that with some of the changes we make this year this won’t continue to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, thanks to everyone that has helped us this last year!
We appreciate all your support, contributions, and patience,
and hope we can make 2017 the year that we can call our project sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;announcing-pydoc-io-beta&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re excited to announce our latest project: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://pydoc.io&quot;&gt;https://pydoc.io&lt;/a&gt;.
This work was made possible by the &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../rtd-awarded-mozilla-open-source-support-grant.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;MOSS Grant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Mozilla.
Thanks to Mozilla for funding our time building this wonderful community resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;about-pydoc-io&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About pydoc.io&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running Read the Docs,
we’ve always been proud of the documentation tooling that the Python community has.
We prioritize prose over API documentation listings,
and generally have a high standard of documentation in our projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a specific set of use cases that API reference documentation support,
and the Python community doesn’t support them well.
Tools like &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://godoc.org&quot;&gt;http://godoc.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://rubydoc.info&quot;&gt;http://rubydoc.info&lt;/a&gt; provide these for others languages,
and we now introduce &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://pydoc.io&quot;&gt;http://pydoc.io&lt;/a&gt; as the Python community’s version of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-is-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pydoc.io will eventually auto-generate API reference documentation for every package on PyPI.
Our beta release will support a limited set of packages that we are using for testing.
Over time we’ll expand the tooling to automatically support generating docs for any package posted on PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference documentation is wonderful for folks who already know how a library works,
and simply want to use it.
It’s also great for navigating and understanding the internals of a piece of code.
Giving them simple access to nicely rendered API documentation supports using and understanding libraries in a nicer way than reading code.
We’re happy to build out these tools,
along with the wonderful prose tools we’ve always had with Sphinx itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our progress and some context is tracked in &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1957&quot;&gt;issue 1957&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-tools&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is built on top of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx&quot;&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; at it’s core.
On top of that,
we’ve layered a few different tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class=&quot;first docutils&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi/&quot;&gt;sphinx-autoapi&lt;/a&gt; which is the tool that takes Python source files and turns them into rST.&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internally, this uses the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle/&quot;&gt;pydocstyle&lt;/a&gt; AST parser, which we use for a parse-only representation of the Python files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/pydoc.io&quot;&gt;pydoc.io&lt;/a&gt; is a Django application that is the actual web front-end and documentation building code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfd/apitheme/&quot;&gt;sphinx-apitheme&lt;/a&gt; is the Sphinx theme that powers the actual API listing pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest piece to call out here is the parse-only documentation generation.
Sphinx’s autodoc module,
and most Python documentation generators rely on importing the code to get docstrings.
As we’ve learned with Read the Docs,
this is quite impractical for a large set of libraries,
including the scientific ecosystem that heavily relies on C libraries.
&lt;strong&gt;Building and supporting a parse-only API tool makes doc builds faster and more reliable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built on top of the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;pydocstyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; AST,
but it looks like we’ll likely have to build out our own AST traversal to retrieve all docstrings and construct declarations that we need to output.
We have looked into some of the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/630&quot;&gt;other AST options&lt;/a&gt; in Python,
but haven’t decided on what direction we want to go when building our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have put a good deal of work into all these different pieces,
but there is still a lot of work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;give-us-feedback&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Give us feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a very beta release&lt;/strong&gt;.
We have developed a few different sets of tools,
and would love your feedback.
In particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give us examples of API documentation patterns that you like. We’d like to incorporate powerful patterns into our theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t give us feedback on specific design issues with the theme, we’re still working on it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let us know if you have ideas about how we can improve the general usability of the documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let us know features that you wish the site had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to Mozilla,
who funded this work.
It wouldn’t have been possible without them,
and we’re happy they funded the initial development.
We’re always looking at ways to make the ongoing maintenance sustainable,
so please reach out to us if you’d like to help with our efforts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
