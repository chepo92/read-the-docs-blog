&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: The migration was successful and the site has been fully restored as of 4PM PST.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make you aware that on Friday, February 12th at 1pm PST (4pm EST, 21:00 UTC),
Read the Docs Community (readthedocs.org) will be having a &lt;strong&gt;scheduled dashboard downtime of approximately 4 hours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure minimal impact for our users,
we are performing this upgrade during a Friday afternoon
which is one of our lowest usage periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this maintenance window, &lt;strong&gt;documentation will continue to be online&lt;/strong&gt;
but new documentation builds will not trigger and the Read the Docs dashboard will be unavailable.
New builds and webhooks will begin processing once the maintenance is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are moving our service to our new home on Amazon Web Services
who have generously provided us with credits to support open source software.
This is the same platform which Read the Docs for Business is hosted,
which will allow us to reuse a lot of the same code between the sites.
This should simplify our operations considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank Microsoft Azure for sponsoring our hosting for the past 2.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your understanding of this maintenance downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;pull-request-builders-available-for-all-users&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/autobuild-docs-for-pull-requests.html&quot;&gt;Pull Request building&lt;/a&gt; is now available for all Read the Docs users.
We have been working on this feature for over a year,
and having it available for all our users is a major milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature allows users to confirm documentation builds correctly for all of their commits,
not just ones merged into branches that are activated on Read the Docs.
This moves documentation into your continuous integration pipeline,
and improves the workflow for everyone working on documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-default&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;GitHub Build Status Reporting for Pull Requests.&quot; src=&quot;../../_images/github-build-status-reporting.gif&quot; style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;GitHub Build Status Reporting for Pull Requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about this new feature in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../building-docs-for-pull-requests.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;previous blog post announcing it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in our &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/guides/autobuild-docs-for-pull-requests.html&quot;&gt;documentation for the feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;serving-docs-for-every-branch&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Serving docs for every branch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with building and validating each branch on your repository,
&lt;strong&gt;we also host a rendered version of the documentation.&lt;/strong&gt;
This allows you to see exactly how the docs will look when they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the documentation on Read the Docs during the development process also helps test integration with Read the Docs.
The entire build process is run for each commit,
so this will ensure that builds work as expected when you’re ready to merge into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These previews will stay live for 90 days from the time you merge or close the Pull Request,
allowing you to finish any outstanding work on the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the increased demand for build resources,
the Pull Request builders have the following limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs search is not enabled on these versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only HTML versions of the documentation are built (not PDF, ePub, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation builds are concurrency limited. Read the Docs for Business concurrency varies based on your plan, and Read the Docs Community are limited to 2 concurrent builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working to address these limitations over time,
but given the increase in scale with these builds it will take some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;give-us-feedback&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Give us feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always love to hear from our users about the product.
If you have feedback on this feature of any others,
you can always reach us at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:hello&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;hello&lt;span&gt;&amp;#64;&lt;/span&gt;readthedocs&lt;span&gt;&amp;#46;&lt;/span&gt;org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: This maintenance window has concluded at 5:40 PM PST.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make you aware that on Friday, February 5 at 5:00pm PST (8:00pm EST, Saturday 01:00 UTC),
Read the Docs for Business (readthedocs.com) will be having a &lt;strong&gt;scheduled downtime of approximately 2 hours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure minimal impact for our users, we are performing this upgrade during a Friday afternoon which is one of our lowest usage periods. This maintenance window is for a required database version upgrade which we couldn’t perform in place. While these kinds of things do happen from time to time, we haven’t had a scheduled downtime on Read the Docs for Business in a few years. Doing this helps us ensure that our services perform well and have up-to-date security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your understanding of this maintenance downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;read-the-docs-is-hiring-for-multiple-positions&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs received a &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../czi-grant-announcement.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;grant to support scientific software&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of this year.
As part of this,
we are hiring for two new positions related to the grant work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../job-frontend.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;frontend developer with design skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;../../job-devrel.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;developer advocate with documentation skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;This position has been filled, and is no longer active&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please look at each of the job postings for much more detail on what to expect with the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to be able to expand our small team and increase the support we’re giving to the scientific open source community.
Throughout 2021 we are going to be vastly improving our documentation and building major new features around embedding documentation content,
based on the work from this grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;how-hiring-will-be-structured&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How hiring will be structured&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we are currently planning to structure this work is to have 50% of the time spent working on grant work,
and the other 50% working on Read the Docs itself.
The codebase and community we’re building require a good amount of onboarding time,
so we are excited to be able to use the grant funds to also improve the overall experience of Read the Docs users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can apply to the jobs with the links above to the full job descriptions,
where you will be asked to fill out a form with a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;about-read-the-docs&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About Read the Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is a large open source project providing documentation building and hosting.
You can think of it a continuous integration for docs.
We do around 500 million pageviews each year.
We are a small team,
but &lt;strong&gt;this role will have a large impact of millions of users.&lt;/strong&gt;
Almost all of our codebase is open source
and we feel strongly about supporting the community while sustaining the project in an ethical manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;announcing-chan-zuckerberg-initiative-grant-to-expand-the-interoperability-of-scientific-documentation&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/&quot;&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt; has received a $200,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/&quot;&gt;Essential Open Source for Science&lt;/a&gt; (EOSS) program.
Read the Docs is the largest open source documentation hosting platform in the world.
We provide hosting for many scientific software packages,
including some that have received EOSS funding in the past.
You can read more about this round of grants in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://cziscience.medium.com/scaling-open-infrastructure-and-reproducibility-in-biomedicine-69546a399747&quot;&gt;official announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our grant has two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 1 allows us to develop new software to improve the interoperability of scientific documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 2 allows us do advocacy work around the importance and value of documentation in the scientific community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited about the chance to work with the scientific community to improve the overall experience of writing and reading documentation.
We plan to do a lot of outreach to various community members,
so that we can ensure we’re building tools that provide the most value.
We also plan to write content that will hopefully make the process of documenting scientific code easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;part-1-improve-the-interoperability-of-scientific-documentation&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part 1: improve the interoperability of scientific documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is something that we’ve been doing as a side project for some time now.
We have an extension to Sphinx that we call &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-hoverxref&quot;&gt;sphinx-hoverxref&lt;/a&gt;.
It provides hovering tooltips for Sphinx projects when hover over a link.
You might be familiar with this functionality on GitHub or Wikipedia – this project adds that functionality to any project hosted on Read the Docs.
You can see a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://cpython-ericholscher.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-hoverxref/whatsnew/3.9.html&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt; on a fork of the Python documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the grant will be to expand this functionality by doing a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving and documenting the backend Embed API on Read the Docs, allowing documentation content to be embedded anywhere on the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a JavaScript client for the Embed API, which includes tooltips showing the content on any website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating this JS client and backend API together in a new version of sphinx-hoverxref.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending sphinx-hoverxref to work across multiple Read the Docs sites, allowing content hovers across the entire scientific documentation ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If time allows, also extending the backend Embed API to support Sphinx documentation hosted outside of Read the Docs, allowing even more interoperability between documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are planning to contract a frontend developer to help with this work.
The Python work will likely be carried out by our existing team,
funded via the grant.
This is because of the complexities involved with the Read the Docs and Sphinx integration,
it will be more cost effective to have people already familiar with the codebases on these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;part-2-advocacy-work-around-documentation-in-the-scientific-community&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part 2: Advocacy work around documentation in the scientific community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that documentation is a pain point for scientific projects. There is a lack of resources in the community, and we feel that we can be a central clearing house for better documentation tutorials and best practices. This part of the funding will be about growing appreciation and knowledge of documentation in the scientific community in general, and advocating for time to be spent on crafting good documentation with the best tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this work would be letting people know about the work in Part 1, promoting the tooling to make better documentation in the Scientific Python ecosystem. Beyond that, we will also promote tutorials and best practices around documentation for Scientific users, leading to more resources being available and better documentation in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level roadmap for this part of the grant is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve documentation and promote the work in Part 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapt the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/&quot;&gt;Guides&lt;/a&gt; section of the Read the Docs documentation into a more full-featured Education section, along with standardizing and editing all existing guides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand our existing &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;Sphinx Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully adding it upstream to Sphinx as the official tutorial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write additional documentation guides focused on the scientific community, based on feedback from people in the community. This will likely include tutorials on integrating Jupyter with Sphinx, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html&quot;&gt;Jupyterbook&lt;/a&gt;, and other pain points that users have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If time allows, we would also love to work on curating some of the documentation resources at &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.writethedocs.org/topics/&quot;&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt;, specifically topics that are relevant to scientific projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this work, we plan to contract someone in a technical writer/developer evangelist role.
Someone with knowledge of the scientific community would be a great benefit,
given that we plan to seek feedback from many scientific projects on the priority of tasks we work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting to look for contractors who would be a good fit for the work.
People who care about documentation and are already connected with the scientific community are a big plus.
We hope to post proper job descriptions for these roles in the near future,
but wanted to note that we’re looking in our initial announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest grant that we’ve ever received,
and we are working hard to make sure it’s successful.
We appreciate the trust that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has placed in us,
and we will work hard to make sure the results of this grant will be adopted across the scientific ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up to date with this work,
you can follow along on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://github.com/readthedocs/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;#mc_embed_signup_scroll&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to our blog for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;shipping-a-cdn-on-read-the-docs-community&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that our Read the Docs Community site has gotten faster in the past few weeks.
How much faster likely depends on how far away you live from Virginia,
which is where our servers have traditionally lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have recently enabled a CDN on &lt;strong&gt;all Read the Docs Community sites&lt;/strong&gt;,
generously sponsored by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;.
This post will talk a bit more about how we implemented this,
and why we’re excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also offering the CDN option to our Read the Docs for Business users on the Enterprise plan,
you can &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;mailto:support&amp;#37;&amp;#52;&amp;#48;readthedocs&amp;#46;org&quot;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt; to us if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;hosting-thousands-of-domains-is-hard&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hosting thousands of domains is hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the largest problem that we’ve had with rolling out features to all of our documentation sites is scale.
We host thousands of custom domains for our users,
and any solution needs to work across all of them.
This has presented a number of issues in the past,
but CDN is one of the most complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a CDN function across all our sites,
every data center that the CDN has needs to work with all our custom domains.
Imagine we have 5,000 domains and there are 100 data centers across the world,
this means that &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;5,000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;500,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; different endpoints need to be configured for this to work at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are lucky that CloudFlare has the global scale to be able to donate us this service.
Specifically,
their &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl-for-saas-providers/&quot;&gt;SSL for SAAS&lt;/a&gt; service is what we’re using for both SSL and CDN across all our custom domains.
This allows us to offload the complexity to CloudFlare,
and only focus on our integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things that CloudFlare’s CDN offers is something called &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169246-Purging-cached-resources-from-Cloudflare#h_6d756ac9-c476-45e8-a5d4-e2a6e45d9dc7&quot;&gt;Cache Tags&lt;/a&gt;.
This lets us add a &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;Cache-Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; header to all the documentation that we serve,
and invalidate the cache using just that tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example,
when you load our docs,
we will return a header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight-default notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;readthedocs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We return a tag that matches both the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;$project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;$project-$version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
This allows us to invalidate the cache for a specific version,
or across the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know,
cache invalidation is one of the harder problems,
so we take a pretty conservative approach.
We invalidate the cache in the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project cache on Project or Domain save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version cache on documentation builds for specific versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client code is quite simple,
a single HTTP request to Cloudflare’s API with a list of &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;outcomes&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important outcomes from this work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page loads are much faster for users around the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our server load has gone down quite a lot because we handle fewer requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest winner here is our users.
Docs are faster for everyone,
and we are looking at implementing additional features into our documentation hosting code now that we have reduced load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that Read the Docs Community has gotten noticeably faster,
and that in the near future it will continue to get better with the new features that this enables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;read-the-docs-offsite-2019&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Read the Docs team just finished our first offsite ever in April of 2019.
We all gathered together in person for the first time,
and talked about the future of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture will show this better than I can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure align-center&quot; id=&quot;id1&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The team at the house we rented in Aruba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full list of attendees, which is the full-time staff, from left to right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Fischer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuel Kaufmann&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric Holscher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anthony Johnson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Santos Gallegos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest goal was building a shared understanding of the vision for the project.
Being fully remote,
it’s often hard to communicate at a deep level about mission and vision.
Being together in person for a week gave us the space to understand each other and our views better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other large goal was to build a roadmap for the next 3-6 months for the project.
We have often had smaller roadmaps,
but never had the chance to discuss all the problems that we encounter with the project,
and then prioritize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;format&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the following format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the offsite, we created a Trello board with a list of topics to discuss. This was all the major feature ideas, issues, and concerns that came up over the previous couple months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first 3 days, we went through the list and discussed each topic. We took notes (almost 20 pages) of these discussions, and mostly tried to build a shared understanding on a path forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4th day we broke each section down into action items, and chunked them into 1-3 smaller sections of work. We called these “v1”, “v2”, and “v3” to break out the stages where each project could be shipped and have impact on our users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 5th day we took all the tasks, then sized and prioritized them. We broke things out into 4 piles representing months going forward, and tried to balance the tasks so each month had a similar amount of work in it. We then turned this into a Trello roadmap board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked quite well for us.
It gave us space to talk through all the various topics we had,
but also gave concrete next steps to move forward on our tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;outcomes&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most valuable outcome is something I said at the offsite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Before, it felt like we were 5 contributors working on an open source project. Now, it feels like we’re members of a team.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each member of the team,
there was someone else they had never met in person before this.
Having all met in person will make it much easier to collaborate online going foward,
and to feel like we are working towards a goal that we all share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of technical output,
the roadmap we have established will make us much more productive in our work going foward.
The entire team now has vision around the roadmap items,
and understands the tasks other people are working on much better.
This has already lead to a much better ability to collaborate together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hoping to do another offsite in 2020,
and if we do our jobs right, hopefully we’ll have another teammate or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
